# 
#	This is my algorithm for sorting socks, 
#  	I am unsure if this has been defined in any sort of literature. 
# 		Google is failing me. So i decided to write it down 
#
#

#Goal
#	quickly, and in liner time, sort n elements in the m like pairs of k types.

#Assumptions
	1. Elements can be quickly identifed as meeting one of the k types
	2. n > m > k
	3. each type is mapped to an integer ie  k0 = 0, k1 = 1, etc

let typeBuffer[] = Array(len = k) 
for each sock in Array(Socks):
	if typeBuffer[sock.type] == NULL
		typeBuffer[sock.type] = sock
	else
		matchPair(sock, typeBuffer[sock.type])
		typeBuffer[sock.type] = NULL
